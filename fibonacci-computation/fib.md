# Fibonacci
In this project we will compare the computational time taken by a recursive algorithm to determine the Fibonacci number of an integer n and the time taken by a bottom-up approach (using a loop)  to calculate the Fibonacci number of the same integer n.

This code contains the same algorithms written in both C++ and Python (written in two just to see if theres any time difference) that computes the time (in seconds using the time library file that takes to determine Fibonacci (n) using FiboR and the time taken by FiboNR on the same input n. Both routines are tested using different values of n.
